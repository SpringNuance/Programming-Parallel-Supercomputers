# Exercise 5 - Hybrid CPU computing

Your tasks were
=============== 

Add loop-level parallelism using openMP to this code,
and assess whether any of the expected benefits, listed below,
discussed in the Lecture 5 materials, can be reached with the methods
that you are knowledgeable with? The openMP methods you learnt during
Programming Parallel Computers course are sufficient. Provide evidence
in the form of tables, plots, â€¦ , and present a short analysis on each
point.

1. reduction in memory usage?

2. performance increase?

3. extended scale up?

The model solutions are presented in this directory, and the performance
and scaling results described in Model_solutions.pdf. This includes some
dos and don'ts found in the student solutions.
