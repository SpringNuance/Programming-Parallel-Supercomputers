In general:
  - no systematic difference between blocking and non-blocking versions of otherwise similar 
    send routines to be expected as MPI_Wait follows immediately after Isend
  - for large message sizes small differences between Send, Isend, Ssend, Issend
    because Send behaves like Ssend, Isend like Issend
  - buffered sends systematically slower for message sizes > 1e3 (1e4) on one node (two nodes)
  - for small message sizes, communication time becomes independent of it as 
    overhead dominates
  - time as function of message size grows faster than any power law 
  - standard deviation of communication time systenatically bigger for buffered send 
    (by >~ one order of magnitude) compared to Send/Recv from 1e3 (3e4) on;
    could indicate that bandwidth for large messages depends more strongly on the (random)
    network load than for smaller messages

Send and receive calls on different nodes (inter-node):
  - nonblocking Send systematically fastest from message size n=3e2 on, 
    from 3e3 on practically equally fast as blocking Send
  - blocking buffered 2nd fastest until n=3e3, then both synchronous sends; 
    unsystematic differences between others for n<3e3
  - buffered send/recv systematically slowest from n=1e4 on,
    by factor ~4 slower for longest arrays

Comparison intra-node vs. inter-node:
  - intra-node 5 to >~ 10 times faster for array lengths n <~ 3e3
    difference reduces to ~0 for longest arrays in all flavors
