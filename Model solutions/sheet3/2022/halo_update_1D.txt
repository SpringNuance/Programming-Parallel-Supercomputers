Halo communication by Send/Recv (blocking/nonblocking)
------------------------------------------------------

see code in halo_update_1D.c, plots in halo1D_blocking_p2p.pdf, halo1D_nonblocking_p2p.pdf;
execution time per iteration from averaging over 100 iterations

- behavior communication-bound for small arrays, compute-bound for large arrays
  changeover depends on processor number p

- for p>=32, only slight dependence of execution time on p when communication-bound (n<~1e6)

- as amount of communicated data (determined completely by stencil order) doesnâ€™t depend on array size,
  execution time is roughly independent of n when communication-bound

- behaviour special for p=4,8,16: code runs for small arrays (n<~1024) up to 100 times faster than for p>16;
  reason: communication was intra-node, exploiting shared memory;
  accordingly, changeover to compute-bound already at n~1e3,1e4,4e4, instead of n>~1e6 for bigger p

- at big n (2^23) strong scaling close to ideal for p <~16 

- nonblocking communication with concurrency of communication and computation 
  slightly faster than blocking when communication-bound for p=32
